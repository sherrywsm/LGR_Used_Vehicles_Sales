# LGR_Used_Vehicles_Sales
Logistic regression on variables about used vehicles by predicting whether a vehicle is overage or not.

Drive-Time is the second largest vehicle retailer in the US focused solely on used vehicles. Drive-Time typically sells about 4 thousand used vehicles per month.

Drive-Time managers wonder whether it is possible to develop selection models for sedans using data from the vehicles database. Is a single model sufficient, or should separate models be built for the stats in which  Drive-Time operated? What would the models look like, and how much profit improvement would result from using the models? Note that each overage vehicle has its sales price reduced in order to encourage the sales within 90-110 day period. Furthermore, if an overage vehicle fails to sell within 120 days, the vehicle is taken off the lot and sold at auction. These overage vehicles incurred a reduction in profit and even a loss to Drive-Time. More specifically, while a non-overage vehicle is sold at a 20% mark-up price, an overage vehicleâ€™s price is set at 10% mark-up and a vehicle is sold at auction at -20% mark-up.
